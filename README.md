This is a repository with a text file from https://justice.oregon.gov/charities listing all of the charities active in Oregon 
and a cleaned up csv file deleting the duplicates, combined half rows, and added 17 charities that was in one row. I also added two columns for the period begining and ending so month and year are seperated. 
The cleaned up file has 22,300 charites listed
